# Mandelbrot Fractal View

## Controls

1. Reset to (0) + (0)i:
  - This button resets the focus point to the origin, re-centreing the fractal.
2. Maximum Iterations:
  - This changes the maximum amount of times the program will iterate to see if a value converges or diverges.
  - A lower value means more points will be classed as converging, losing some detail.
3. Magnitude Threshold:
  - As the program iterates the expression on any point, if the output is greater than this threshold, the point will be classed as diverging.
  - Higher threshold results in more fine detail, whilst a lower threshold gives a mmore expansive view.
4. Render Time
  - The amount of time (in milliseconds) that it takes for your computer to render the current frame.
5. Colour Shift:
  - This is purely cosmetic, and merely changes the pretty colours of the visualisation.
