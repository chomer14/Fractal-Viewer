            <h3 id="resetToOriginBtn">Reset To Origin</h3>
            <p>This resets the visualiser to have it's central point be at 0+0i (or (0,0)).</p>

            <h3 id="resetScaleLbl">Reset Scale</h3>
            <p>This resets the visualiser to have it's scale to 175x, which is roughly the area from (-1.4-1.4i) to (1.4+1.4i) when the size of the picture is 500px x 500px.</p>

            <h3>Render Time</h3>
            <p>This is a measure of how long it took for your computer to generate the image of the fractal based on the parameters selected. Measured in milliseconds.</p>

            <h3 id="magThresholdSldr">Magnitude Threshold</h3>
            <p>This controls what value of z is considered to be divergant. For example, if this value is 2, then that means for a value to be defined as diverging (growing to infinity), the absolute value of z must be greater than 2. This definies which pixels are classed as divergent (coloured in).</p>


            <h3 id="maxIterSldr">Maximum Iterations</h3>
            <p>This changes how many iterations of the formula defined are applied to any pixel. If the value has not diverged (become greater than the magnitude threshold) by the time maximum iterations has been reached, the pixel is classed as convergent (not coloured in, approaches a single value). Higher values results in higher levels of detail.</p>

            <h3 id="colourShiftSldr">Colour Shift</h3>
            <p>This allows the user to change the base colour of the fractal.</p>
